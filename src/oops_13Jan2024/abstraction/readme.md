showing only the essential features of an object to the user and hiding the inner details to reduce complexity

Eg:
Car -->  break, clutch , wheel, handle, accelerator

Hidden: engine, break mechanism

How do we achieve it:

1. Abstract class
2. Interface

Abstract Class: 
1. Abstract is a keyword

2. Abstract can be class or method both
3. Abstract class cannot be instantiated i.e we cannot create object of the abstract class
4.
